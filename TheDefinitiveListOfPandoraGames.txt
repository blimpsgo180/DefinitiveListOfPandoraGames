[SIZE=6][B]General Overview[/B][/SIZE]
[SIZE=4]
With the days of the Pandora winding down and the days of the Pyra winding... up(?), I've decided to create a definitive list of all the games that exist on the Pandora.

I'm categorizing games as games that were either made for, or specifically ported to the Pandora.  I do not count games that run on an emulator as games in this list.  Additionally, I don't count things like [/SIZE][URL='http://www.repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=scummvm.djwillis.0001'][SIZE=4]ScummVM[/SIZE][/URL][SIZE=4] or [/SIZE][URL='http://www.repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=gemrb-31292'][SIZE=4]GemRB[/SIZE][/URL][SIZE=4], because they play multiple games.  This list is really about [/SIZE][B][SIZE=4]individual games for Pandora[/SIZE][/B][SIZE=4].

[B]SOME OF THE GAMES ON THIS LIST REQUIRE YOU PURCHASE A COPY OF THE GAME OUTSIDE OF THE PANDORA REPO.[/B]  Though not always directly through the Pandora repository, games like [URL='http://www.repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=jedioutcast_ptitseb']Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast[/URL] and [URL='http://www.repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=rtcw_ptitseb']Return to Castle Wolfenstein[/URL] require a purchase outside of the Pandora repository.  These games will have a note that a purchase is required directly beneath the game's title, and the note will contain a link to where you can make the purchase.
[/SIZE]
[B][SIZE=6]Nitty Gritty
[/SIZE][/B]
[SIZE=4]I intend to include the following things with each game:[/SIZE]
[LIST]
[*][SIZE=4]Screenshots from the game.  If a shot from the Pandora is available, I'll use that.  Otherwise, I'll use images from other sources (official website, etc.)[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]A video of the game on YouTube.  If I can find a YouTube video of the game running on Pandora, I will use that.  Otherwise, I'll use another video.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]A thank you to the author of the port or original game for their work.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Score of the game in the repo.  Most scores of the games in the repo are really high, probably as a way of saying thank you to the person who ported it.  It's because of this, that I'll also include...[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]A score from external website.  I'm partial to User Scores on [URL='http://www.mobygames.com/']MobyGames.com[/URL].  If a score isn't available there, I'll try to find a score somewhere else.  If I can't find a score at all, I'll post that I can't find an external score.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]The next three I might need help from the community on.  The first is Accuracy (out of five). This is specific to ports.  How accurate is the game on Pandora compared to the game on the original platform?[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Next is Speed.  Does it run at the same speed it does on the original platform.  Again, out of five.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Last of the three, I'd like to include "Playability".  Sometimes, games that were designed for mouse and keyboard (for example) don't lend themselves to touchscreen, traditional gaming controls, and a reduced-size keyboard.  A bit of honesty from the community would be appreciated here.  Out of five.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]A synopsis of the game.  Will be taken from the Repo, or whichever source has the best written, succinct synopsis (Wikipedia, MobyGames, etc).  Source will be noted.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Finally, I will include a link to the game in the repo.[/SIZE]
[/LIST]

[B][SIZE=6]Questions:[/SIZE][/B]

[INDENT][SIZE=4][B]Q: Why are you making this list?  Most of this information is available in the repo![/B]
[B]A:[/B] I think it's more convenient to have a big informative list with screenshots and synopses that you can scroll through than to have a list of only game names and score out of five stars.  Also, I'm trying to include information not available in the repo.  For example, external reviews (perhaps from multiple sources) and an honest-to-goodness assessment of how well the game plays on Pandora.  There's certainly room for more information.  As the maintainer of this thread, I will take feedback from the community, and update this post accordingly.

[B]Q: You didn't include a game![/B]
[B]A:  [/B]I tried to include everything.  Please make a post with the game or games I missed and I'll add it to this post.

[B]Q: I want to download all of the games![/B]
[B]A:[/B] I think that's a good idea.  Maybe we could organize games into two directories -- "requires purchase", and "does not require purchase" -- and make a torrent to link to in this thread.

[B]Q: The list would be better if you did this specific thing to it.[/B]
[B]A:  [/B]Again, I'm open to feedback.

[B]Q: This thread blew up my smartphone![/B]
[B]A: [/B] No comment.[/SIZE][/INDENT]


[SIZE=6][B]Final Notes:[/B][/SIZE]
[SIZE=4]
I'm trying to get this thread stickied... but if it's not stickied, that's OK.[/SIZE]

[SIZE=4]Let's get right to it![/SIZE]

[INDENT][SIZE=4]Area 2048 is a retro-type shooter which disguises its excellent use of graphics and effects by using an Asteroid type design.

The game operates based ona simple concept, eliminate all enemies in a map to move-on to the next one, while every few maps you get a boss enemy. Your weapons are, rapid-fire missiles and a special weapon, needs recharging between uses, which can get you out of messy situations. In [B]Area 2048 [/B]the music is a techno-like sound which seems to fit-in very well with the game, while some Japanese (I believe) chatter, comes up every time you complete a level.[/SIZE][/INDENT]

[INDENT][SIZE=4]The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game with a fantasy theme.
Build up a great army, gradually training raw recruits into hardened veterans. In later games, recall your toughest warriors and form a deadly host against whom none can stand! Choose units from a large pool of specialists, and hand pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on different terrains against all manner of opposition.
Wesnoth has many different sagas waiting to be played out. You can battle orcs, undead, and bandits on the marches of the Kingdom of Wesnoth; fight alongside dragons in the lofty peaks, elves in the green reaches of the Aethenwood, dwarves in the great halls of Knalga, or even merfolk in the Bay of Pearls. You can fight to regain the throne of Wesnoth, or use your dread power over the Undead to dominate the land of mortals, or lead your glorious Orcish tribe to victory against the humans who dared despoil your lands.[/SIZE][/INDENT]

[INDENT][SIZE=4]Brogue is a Roguelike game by Brian Walker.

You are the @ symbol. Move around the dungeon with the mouse, the vi-keys (hjklyubn) or keypad keys. The arrow keys will also work, but they do not allow diagonal movement. Your goal is to travel to the 26th subterranean floor of the dungeon, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor and return with it to the surface. For the truly skillful who desire further challenge, depths below 26 contain three lumenstones each -- items which confer no benefit except an increased score upon victory.[/SIZE][/INDENT]

Gameplay is viewed from just above and behind the car. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose the player's time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing the player to choose which direction he or she wishes to go in. The player has to to complete five track sections in total, out of the fifteen in the game.[/SIZE][/INDENT]

[B]Synopsis (from MobyGames.com):[/B][/SIZE]
[INDENT][SIZE=4]The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.

id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining [URL='http://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Wolfenstein+3D']Wolfenstein 3D[/URL], [I]DOOM[/I] is another first-person 3D shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, [I]Knee-Deep in the Dead[/I], takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in [I]The Shores of Hell[/I] and culminates in [I]Inferno[/I], the final episode which takes place in Hell itself.[/SIZE][/INDENT]

[INDENT][SIZE=4]Harmony is a 11-level stand-alone total conversion, created by Thomas van der Velden and released after five years of development.

In the near future: Led by greed and hatred mankind drove itself into another world war. The forces of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere attacked each other with everything their destructive arsenal had to offer. Nuclear, chemical and biological weapons wiped out entire countries. The combined effect of the weapons resulted in an unforeseen side effect; a supervirus emerged that mutated all the men on Earth. For unknown reasons the women were unaffected. But they weren't safe either...

The mutated men, though intelligent, lost touch with reality. From their corrupted minds a new order was formed; 'the Pax Pox'. Its first priority is to rid the world of the "impure".

The women who survived the war united to form an army against the mutant aggressors and called themselves "the Amazons".

Today one of the Amazon outposts is attacked and their leader; Amira is taken captured. Her last hope is her loyal friend; Harmony.

Will Harmony be able to rescue her friend and the rest of the human race?[/SIZE][/INDENT]

[INDENT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4]Welcome to the Arena, where high-ranking warriors are transformed into spineless mush. Abandoning every ounce of common sense and any trace of doubt, you lunge onto a stage of narrowing landscapes and veiled abysses. Your new environment rejects you with lava pits and atmospheric hazards as legions of foes surround you, testing the gut reaction that brought you here in the first place. Your new mantra, fight or be finished.[/SIZE][/FONT][/INDENT]

[B]Synopsis (from MobyGames.com):[/B][/SIZE]
[INDENT][SIZE=4]Jazz the jackrabbit was just about to marry his girlfriend Eva Earlong, when his arch-nemesis, the turtle Devan Shell, stole the wedding ring. To add insult to injury, Eva's hostile mother has locked Jazz and his brother Spaz in a dungeon. The two hares must escape, retrieve the precious jewel, and punish Devan for his evil deeds.

Like its predecessor, [I]Jazz Jackrabbit 2[/I] is a platform shooter. Unlike the previous installment, the sequel allows the player to control Spaz as well. Jazz retains his ability to hover in the air by using his ears, and Spaz can stomp and smash enemies. The hares use a default blaster gun with unlimited ammunition and can later acquire more powerful weapons, a few of which (e.g. a freezing gun) were not found in the first game. Coins can be found throughout the stages and then given to vendors to access bonus areas.[/SIZE][/INDENT]

[INDENT][SIZE=4]In [I]Jedi Outcast[/I], you once again play Kyle Katarn, star of LucasArts' Star Wars-inspired 1st-person shooters Star Wars: Dark Forces and Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II.

Kyle has retired from being a Jedi fearing consequences from the Dark Side of the Power found within himself during his chase of the foul Sith-Lord Jerec into the lost vale of the Jedi at the end of Dark Forces 2. Chronologically taking place after the second Star Wars Trilogy, you'll meet various well known people from the original Star Wars movies like Luke Skywalker himself and Lando Calrissian.

Also following the tradition of its predecessors, you explore the surroundings in the typical 3D environment and can use a lot of different weapons and gear from the Star Wars Universe, including the famous Jedi Weapon, the light saber.[/SIZE][/INDENT]

[INDENT][SIZE=4]It's a tribute to the Metal Slug Serie from Clément CORDE.

It is a game composed of 3 Missions (each mission divided into a number of levels). The first mission is similar to the serie, then it forks and offers some refreshing gameplay (find the submarine in mission two if you can!). But first mission alone will not be easy to complete ![/SIZE][/INDENT]
